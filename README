Happy troll hunting with this competition grade Trollometer.
This Trollometer will indicate whether a web page is trolliferous or not !
The higher the score, the better chances are a troll is hiding there.

The score should appear as a bar on the top of the page green is good. Red is bad.


== Install ==

Debian:
  # aptitude install python-tornado python-daemon

OS X:
  # easy_install setuptools pycurl==7.16.2.1 simplejson
  # pip install lxml

Then you should install tornado
  $ git clone git://github.com/facebook/tornado
  $ cd tornado
  $ python setup.py build
  # python setup.py install

and  python-daemon (for os x ignore the setup tools already done):
  # aptitude install setuptools
  $ wget 'http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/python-daemon/python-daemon-1.5.1.tar.gz#md5=46abde3f848aaaed0df3b1fe938234f0'
  $ tar xvzf python-daemon-1.5.1.tar.gz
  $ cd python-daemon-1.5.1/
  $ python setup.py build
  # python setup.py install



You can now launch the Trollometer
  $ ./trollometre 8000
Which should be accessible here: http://localhost:8000/

If you would like to run it publicly accessible you can proxify it behind:
nginx - http://wiki.nginx.org/. The doc/nginx.conf file is an example of a
Proxified configuration for the requests from nginx to the Trollometer.

If you don't have ngins running you can always you good olf apache2 with the
mod_proxy_balancer. You can find an example vhost configuration file under:
 doc/apache2.conf.
